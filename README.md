# MERN Authentication Project

A MERN stack application designed for secure user authentication, featuring a user-friendly interface, an admin dashboard (optional), and a robust authorization system. This project demonstrates effective use of Redux for state management and JWT for secure user authentication and role-based access control.

## ✨ Features

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend:** React.js with Redux for global state management.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js, serving as the RESTful API that handles requests, manages authentication, and enforces authorization.
- **Database:** MongoDB (or your preferred database), used to store user data securely.

## Project Details

### User Side
- **Login / Register:** Secure login and registration with password encryption.
- **Home Page:** Accessible after login, with navigation to user profile.
- **User Profile:** Displays user details (optional: upload and update a profile image).

### Admin Side (Optional)
- **Admin Login:** Secure login page for the admin.
- **User Management:**
  - View all users in the database.
  - Search users based on criteria.
  - Edit user details for efficient user management (delete functionality optional).
