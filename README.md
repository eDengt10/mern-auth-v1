# MERN Authentication Project

A MERN stack application designed for secure user authentication, featuring a user-friendly interface, an admin dashboard, and a robust authorization system. This project demonstrates effective use of **Redux** for state management and **JWT** for secure user authentication and role-based access control.

## Features

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: React.js with Redux for global state management, providing an optimized and organized way to manage complex states.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, serving as the RESTful API that handles requests, manages authentication, and enforces authorization.
- **Database**: MongoDB (or your preferred database), used to store user data securely.
